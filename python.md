## The Programming Language

Python has a powerful standard library and is relatively easy to use due to its more abstract concepts compared to e.g. C/C++...

### The Official Python Tutorial

The official Python documentaion provides a great source of knowledge and is a good starting point for learning Python.

To provide a first and basic impression of Python the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is refered to introduce the following aspects in a very short amount of time:

1. Data Types (Chapter 3)
2. Control Flows (Chapter 4 - 4.5)
3. Data Structures (Chapter 5)

> It is also worth reading the introduction and the first two chapters of the tutorial!  

### Learn Python the Hard Way

To dive directly into the practical part of programming with Python the book __Learn Python the Hard Way__ is used. This book follows a non conventional approach which goes directly to the practical part and let you write some code first and think after.  

This book is taken into account for teaching Python programming when the time window is not to tiny.

The exercises in the book will be grouped into modules where each module represents a check point for reviewing the content learned:

* Module 1 (Exercise 1 - 10): Comments, Variables and Printing
* Module 2 (Exercise 11 - 14): Parameter and Prompting
* Module 3 (Exercise 15 - 17): Reading and Writing Files
* Module 4 (Exercise 18 - 24): Functions, More File Operations and Return Values
* Module 5 (Exercise 23 - 26): Code Reviewing and Fixing
* Module 6 (Exercise 27 - 31): Boolean Algebra and Control Flows
* Module 7 (Exercise 32 - 34): More Control Flows and Data Structures
* Module 8 (Exercise 35): Reviewing and Extending a Little Game
* Module 9 (Exercise 36): Designing and Implementing a Little Game
* Module 10 (Exercise 37): Reviewing Symbols and Reading Code
* Module 11 (Exercise 38 - 39): More about Data Structures
* Module 12 (Exercise 40-42): Modules, Classes and Objects
